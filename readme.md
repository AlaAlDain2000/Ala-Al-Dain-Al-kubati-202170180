This project aims to simulate an autonomous self-driving car using Python, integrating machine learning techniques to train virtual cars to navigate a track successfully. Leveraging the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm, the simulation evolves neural networks that control the car's decision-making abilities, allowing it to learn how to drive effectively through iterative improvements over multiple generations.

The simulation is built with Pygame, a Python library for creating graphical simulations, providing a visual representation of cars navigating a track. Each car is equipped with virtual sensors (radars) that detect distances to track boundaries, allowing the neural network to make informed decisions regarding acceleration, braking, and steering. The fitness function, based on distance traveled and time alive, guides the evolution of better driving behavior over time.

The project demonstrates the use of genetic algorithms for training agents in dynamic environments and provides a hands-on application of reinforcement learning concepts. It offers insight into the potential and challenges of self-driving technologies, including sensor data processing, decision-making, and collision avoidance.
